# mosaic-filter

step for developing
- [ ] get how many picture to use in filtering & change that value to fit in that picture
> maybe impossible for now
- [ ] calculate size of each grid
> we try to have user input this value by themselves for now
- [ ] find values of each grid (eg. top-right top-left bottom-right bottom-left pixels)
- [ ] calculate mean of RGB values in that grid
> and maybe picture that will be paste in
- [ ] paste that grid with another picture with closest RGB values
