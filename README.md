# mosaic-filter

step for developing
- [x] get how many picture to use in filtering & change that value to fit in that picture (or have user input the size of image directly)
- [x] calculate size of each grid
- [x] find values of each grid (eg. top-right top-left bottom-right bottom-left pixels)
- [x] calculate mean of RGB values in that grid
> and image that will be paste in
- [ ] paste that grid with another picture with closest RGB values

step for getting resource (image scraping)
- [ ] get more number of image by selenium webdriver (against infinite scrolling)
- [ ] get original image instead of result by google search (maybe by selenium clicking and stuff)
